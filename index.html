    <h1>Most Hated Subject in 9B</h1>
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p>The majority of 9B picked Physics. They say because there are too many formulas to remember, so they think it is difficult. Some students say it is because of the teacher. Some say it is because the subject isn't fun. Physics is just very difficult for 9B students. We all know that's all true.
</p>
    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <p>Some chose Math, it was almost a tie against Physics, most students just hates Physics much more than Math. It's difficult for them. They say couting is too frustating. Completing the questions takes a long time to finish. I agree with them.</p>
    <h2>Social Studies</h2>
    <p>Two students chose Social Studies. They both say it is very boring. The teacher is also a reason why they hate Social Studies, I completely agree. The subject we are talking about keeps getting repeated every year, I wonder when we're actually gonna learn something new. They just hate Social Studies that much.</p>
